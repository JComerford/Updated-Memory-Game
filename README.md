# Memory Game Project

This project was assigned through Udacity's Front End Web Development Program.  Udacity gave me starter code in the index.html, css, and a function to shuffle the cards which still needed to be called in some way from another function. 

Resources used for this project were:
* The Udacity lessons leading up to this project
* MDN & W3schools.com documentation
* Mike Wales FEND webinar - https: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y
* Matthew Cranford 's Blog, "Journey to Greatness" - https://matthewcranford.com
* Numerous Stackoverflow questions/answers from other users.  Although I did not pose questions myself, they helped lead me in the right direction.

Although these sources were used, I then needed to adapt my project so I wrote the code.  By doing so, this project has helped me understand a lot more than I did when I started.
